    <ul>
        <li>High string action makes playing uncomfortable</li>
        <li>Fret buzz due to low action or uneven frets</li>
        <li>Old or rusty strings affecting sound quality</li>
        <li>Loose tuning pegs causing tuning instability</li>
        <li>Dirty fretboard impacting playability</li>

        <h2 tabindex="0">String Action Height</h2>
        <p>
            String action height refers to the distance between the bottom of your guitarâ€™s strings and
            the top of the frets, measured at the 12th fret.
            This measurement is vital for ensuring your guitar is comfortable to play,
            free of buzzing, and capable of producing the desired tone.

    <h2 tabindex="0">Fret buzz due to low action or uneven frets</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Low string action: The strings are too close to the frets, causing them to vibrate against the fret wires.</li>
        <li>Uneven or worn frets: Some frets are higher than others, so strings hit them when played.</li>
        <li>Neck issues: The neck may be bowed or warped, affecting string clearance.</li>
        <li>Improper setup: Incorrect truss rod adjustment, bridge height, or nut slots.</li>
        <li>Old or poor-quality strings: Strings that are worn or not properly installed can buzz.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 tabindex="0">Adjusting your guitar trussrod</h2>
    <p>
        Adjusting your guitar's truss rod helps control the neck's curvature, ensuring proper string action and playability.
        To adjust, locate the truss rod access (usually at the headstock or near the neck joint).
        Use the correct wrench to turn the truss rod:
        - Clockwise tightens and straightens the neck (reduces relief).
        - Counterclockwise loosens and adds more curve (increases relief).
        Make small adjustments (about a quarter turn at a time), then check the neck relief and playability.
        Always tune your guitar before and after adjustments, and avoid forcing the truss rod to prevent damage.
